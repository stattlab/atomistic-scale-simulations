# Introduction

To be able to perform any particle based simulation, we need a **molecular model** of what all compontents in the system look like and how each component interact with each other. The particles could be representing atoms, or a group of atoms, or nanoparticles, or colloids, or many other representations of the system of interest.

Once a model is established, and interactions are defined, we ...
