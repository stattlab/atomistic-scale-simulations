# Using MD Packages

## Anatomy of an MD Simulation Workflow

### Initialization

- Create initial configuration and parameterize the force field.
- **Tools:** `packmol`, `mbuild/Foyer`, `ambertools`, etc.

### Equilibration

- **Energy Minimization:** Removes overlaps or poor initial configurations to prevent simulation instability.
  - Methods: Steepest Descent, Conjugate Gradient, L-BFGS, FIRE.
- **NVT Ensemble:** Brings system to correct temperature.
  - Use aggressive thermostats (e.g., Isokinetic, Berendsen, Langevin).
  - Be cautious if initial velocities are zero (can cause divide-by-zero errors).
- **NPT Ensemble:** Brings system to correct density.
  - Barostat usually has a longer time constant than thermostat.
  - Ensure momentum is zeroed when switching from non-conserving thermostats.
- Simulate for multiple relaxation times to ensure equilibrium.
  - Use transport coefficients to estimate required time.
  - Monitor observables like energy (U), radial distribution function (g(r)), and density.

## Production

- Run long enough to gather statistically independent samples of quantities of interest.
- Trajectory dumping can be disk-intensive—choose frequency wisely.
- Use **checkpointing** (saving restart files) to recover from hardware failures.

## Post-processing

- Write scripts to compute properties, averages, etc., from simulation outputs.
- Can be done on HPC clusters or downloaded to local machines.
- Use existing tools and methods when possible—avoid reinventing the wheel.

## Tips

- Choose the largest time step (Δt) that still ensures accurate integration—test this.
- Tune hyperparameters for performance using representative simulations.
- Run multiple simulation copies to improve statistics and estimate errors.
- Organize files clearly during parameter sweeps. Example structure:

data/ ├── T-1.0/ │ ├── V-20/ │ │ └── input.sh │ ├── V-30/ │ │ └── input.sh ├── T-1.5/ │ ├── V-205/ │ └── V-301/

- Consider using tools to manage simulation campaigns.

## Recommended MD Packages

- **GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM, AMBER** – widely used in biophysics.
- **LAMMPS, HOOMD-blue** – general-purpose physics simulations.

Always read the documentation for your chosen tool carefully!
