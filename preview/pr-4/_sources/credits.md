Many derivations, examples and problem statements were adapted from textbooks, in particular: Allen, Michael P., and Dominic J. Tildesley. "Computer simulation of liquids.", Oxford (1987).

The class CHEN 6970 from Prof. [Michael P. Howard](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/directory/mph0043) at Auburn University was particularly useful in setting this course up.

A lot of the material, especially for the chapters on Monte Carlo simulations, are old notes from D. Ceperly and D.  Johnson, who have taught this class at UIUC for many years.
