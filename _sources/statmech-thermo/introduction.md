# Introduction

In this section, we will cover some neccessary background in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, as well as errors and structural and dynamic correlations, i.e, transport coefficients. Note that most of this chapter is covered very well in various textbooks, for example:

- Ken Dill "Molecular Driving Forces: Statistical Thermodynamics in Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Nanoscience"{cite}`dill2010molecular`
- Scott Shell "Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics: An Integrated Approach" {cite}`shell2015thermodynamics`
