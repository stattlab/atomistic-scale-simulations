# Introduction

To be able to perform any particle based simulation, we need a **molecular model** of what all compontents in the system look like and how each component interact with each other. The particles could be representing atoms, or a group of atoms, or nanoparticles, or colloids, or many other representations of the system of interest.

Once a **model** is established, and interactions are defined, we can then think about **what to measure** (many quantities are discussed in the chapter on  [statistical mechanics and thermodynamics](../statmech-thermo/index.md)), and **how to measure** with  [molecular dynamics](../molecular-dynamics/index.md) or  [Monte Carlo](../monte-carlo/index.md) simulations.
