These notes are based on many different sources and textbooks.
The class CHEN 6970 from Prof. [Michael P. Howard](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/directory/mph0043) at Auburn University was particularly useful.

Many derivations, examples and problem statements were adapted from textbooks, in particular: Allen, Michael P., and Dominic J. Tildesley. "Computer simulation of liquids.", Oxford (1987).
