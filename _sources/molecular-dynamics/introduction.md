# Introduction

In this section, we will discuss the basic fundamentals of a **molecular dynamics** simulation. We will cover verlet integration for NVE ensemble simulations, thermostats and langevin dynamics for NVT, as well as technical topics like neighbor lists and searching, and high performance computing.
